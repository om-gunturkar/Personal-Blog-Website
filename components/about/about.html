          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Om ðŸ‘‹</p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a Computer Science enthusiast who loves exploring technology,
            building projects, and sharing ideas. My interests span across **Web
            Development**, **Data Science**, and **AI/ML**, but I also enjoy
            diving into design and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about fitness, spending time at the
            gym, and keeping myself disciplined both mentally and physically. I
            also love creating digital notes on my iPad (GoodNotes 5 is my go-to
            app!), which helps me stay organized and creative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects, participated in
            hackathons, and built apps that combine functionality with good
            design. I believe in continuous learning and using technology to
            solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>Some of my key skills include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Programming:</strong> JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Design & Organization:</strong> Figma, GoodNotes, UI/UX
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Consistency, Problem-Solving,
              Adaptability
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ðŸŒŸ **Fun Fact:** I balance my life between coding sessions and heavy
            lifting at the gymâ€”it keeps both my brain and body sharp!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vision:</strong> My goal is to grow as a developer and
            create meaningful projects while sharing my journey and helping
            others along the way.
